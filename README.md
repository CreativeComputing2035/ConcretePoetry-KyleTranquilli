Readers have been in a horrible plane crash and are stranded in the wilderness. They must make critical decisions in order to survive the harsh conditions of the forest. 

My process for this game consisted of creating various HTML files that use interconnecting links as a way to create an interactive narrative. First, I developed a concept for the game where readers would help decide the fate of the lost traveler. I would then develop various scenarios that where readers were to use their best judgment to guide their traveler to safety. 

Using the various tags that we learned in class, I created central documents that would pose questions. From there, two additional files were created to act as responses to the questions. If readers chose the incorrect answer, they were redirected back to the “start” page. 

My intentions for this assignment were to create a fun, interactive game for readers to enjoy. Additionally, I intended to explore and utilize the various tags that HTML has to offer to expand on my understanding of the language.
